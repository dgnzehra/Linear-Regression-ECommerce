# Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression for predicting yearly customer spending based on e-commerce data. It includes data exploration, model building, and evaluation using Python libraries.

# Steps in the Project

1- Data Exploration:

Visualize relationships between features and the target variable using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Key visualizations include joint plots, pair plots, and regression plots.

2- Data Preparation:

Features used: Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership.

Target variable: Yearly Amount Spent.

Data split into training and testing sets.

3- Model Training:

Model: Linear Regression using scikit-learn.

Coefficients of the regression model analyzed.

4- Model Evaluation:

Predictions compared against test data.

Evaluation metrics:

  Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  
  Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5- Residual Analysis:

Residual distribution plotted to check normality.

Probability plot generated using SciPy.
